# ir-tools

These two tools are intended to facilitate institutional repository work at Kingsborough. They are:
1.  A script to take data from a gmail folder full of google alerts and turn them into a spreadsheet
2.  A script to check rights of a google sheet full of targets, via Sherpa/RoMEO

At the moment, `make-spreadsheet.py` works as intended, but `fetch-permissions.py` still needs some work.
